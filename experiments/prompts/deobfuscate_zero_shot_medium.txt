Deobfuscate the following {language} code with MEDIUM intensity to make it moderately more readable while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

MEDIUM Deobfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The deobfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Moderate Cleanup**: Apply these improvements:
   - Rename ALL variables to clear, descriptive, domain-appropriate names
   - Add detailed comments explaining logic and purpose
   - Restructure for clarity:
     * Replace nested ternary operators with clear if-else statements
     * Simplify complex expressions by introducing well-named intermediate variables
     * Extract repeated logic into small helper functions
     * Reorder statements into logical groups with comments
   - Improve loop clarity (e.g., while → for where more readable)
   - Remove unnecessary intermediate variables that don't add clarity
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **Balance**: Make code significantly clearer without over-engineering
5. **Length Constraint**: Code may be up to 50% longer than original for clarity, but avoid excessive verbosity

Target: Cyclomatic complexity may decrease by 10-30%


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
