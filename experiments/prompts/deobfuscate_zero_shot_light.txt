Deobfuscate the following {language} code with LIGHT intensity to make it slightly more readable while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

LIGHT Deobfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The deobfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Basic Cleanup**: Apply ONLY these minimal improvements:
   - Rename variables to meaningful, descriptive names based on their purpose
   - Add basic comments explaining what each major section does
   - Improve whitespace and indentation for readability
   - Keep overall structure unchanged
3. **DO NOT**:
   - Restructure control flow or logic
   - Extract or inline functions
   - Change algorithm implementation
   - Add error handling or validation
4. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
5. **Length Constraint**: Keep code length similar to original (±20% lines of code)

Target: Cyclomatic complexity should remain identical to original


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
