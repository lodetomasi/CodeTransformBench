Obfuscate the following {language} code with LIGHT intensity to make it slightly harder to understand while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

LIGHT Obfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The obfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Minimal Changes**: Apply ONLY these techniques:
   - Rename variables to short, non-descriptive names (a, b, x1, tmp, etc.)
   - Remove ALL comments and docstrings
   - Minimize whitespace (but keep code valid)
   - Keep overall structure and logic flow unchanged
3. **DO NOT**:
   - Restructure control flow
   - Add unnecessary operations
   - Inline or extract functions
   - Change algorithm structure
4. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
5. **Length Constraint**: Keep code length similar to original (±20% lines of code)

Target: Cyclomatic complexity should remain similar to original (±10%)

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
