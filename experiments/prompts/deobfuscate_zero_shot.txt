Deobfuscate the following {language} code to make it clear and readable while preserving its exact functionality.

Obfuscated code:
```{language}
{code}
```

Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The deobfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Improve Clarity**: Use techniques like:
   - Rename variables to descriptive names (count, index, result, etc.)
   - Remove unnecessary intermediate variables
   - Replace cryptic operations with clear, standard patterns
   - Add proper structure and spacing
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **Add Documentation**: Add clear comments explaining the logic

Output ONLY the deobfuscated code (no explanations, no markdown formatting).
The code should be ready to save and execute.
