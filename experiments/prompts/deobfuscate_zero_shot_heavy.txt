Deobfuscate the following {language} code with HEAVY intensity to make it maximally readable and clear while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

HEAVY Deobfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The deobfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Maximum Clarity**: Apply ALL these techniques aggressively:
   - Use highly descriptive, self-documenting variable and function names
   - Add comprehensive documentation:
     * Docstrings/comments for overall purpose
     * Inline comments explaining non-obvious logic
     * Comments describing intent, not just mechanics
   - Completely restructure for optimal readability:
     * Replace ALL complex expressions with clear, step-by-step operations
     * Convert nested ternary operators to explicit if-else blocks
     * Extract ALL repeated logic into well-named helper functions
     * Apply standard design patterns where appropriate
     * Organize code into logical sections with clear separation
   - Simplify control flow to be as linear and obvious as possible
   - Add proper error handling if it improves clarity (but preserve original behavior)
   - Use language-specific best practices and idioms
   - Format according to language style guides
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **Professional Quality**: Code should look like it was written by an experienced developer following best practices
5. **Length Constraint**: Maximum 2× original lines of code. Add clarity through structure and naming, not excessive comments

Target: Cyclomatic complexity should decrease by 30-50%


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
