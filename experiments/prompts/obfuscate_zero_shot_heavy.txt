Obfuscate the following {language} code with HEAVY intensity to make it maximally harder to understand while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

HEAVY Obfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The obfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Maximum Obfuscation**: Apply ALL these techniques aggressively:
   - Rename ALL identifiers to cryptic, meaningless names (x1, x2, a, b, tmp, arr, val, etc.)
   - Remove ALL comments and docstrings
   - Heavily restructure control flow:
     * Replace if-else chains with nested ternary operators
     * Convert loops to recursive functions or vice versa where possible
     * Combine multiple operations into single complex expressions
     * Add many intermediate variables for trivial operations
   - Inline small functions into main logic OR extract single lines into separate functions
   - Reorder all independent statements to maximize confusion
   - Replace clear operators with equivalent but obscure alternatives
   - Add dead code branches that never execute but complicate analysis
   - Use bitwise operations where semantically equivalent to arithmetic
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **Maximize Complexity**: Aim to significantly increase cyclomatic complexity
5. **Length Constraint**: Maximum 2× original lines of code. Be thorough but concise - no unnecessary bloat

Target: Cyclomatic complexity should increase by 50-100% or more


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
