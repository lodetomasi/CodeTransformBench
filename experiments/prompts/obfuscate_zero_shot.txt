Obfuscate the following {language} code to make it harder to understand while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The obfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Increase Complexity**: Use techniques like:
   - Rename variables to meaningless names (x1, x2, tmp, etc.)
   - Add unnecessary intermediate variables
   - Replace clear logic with equivalent but cryptic operations
   - Inline or extract functions to confuse structure
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **No Comments**: Remove all comments and docstrings

Output ONLY the obfuscated code (no explanations, no markdown formatting).
The code should be ready to save and execute.
