Refactor the following {language} code with LIGHT intensity to make minimal improvements while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

LIGHT Refactoring Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The refactored code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Minimal Improvements**: Apply ONLY these basic changes:
   - Rename variables and functions to more descriptive names
   - Fix inconsistent naming conventions
   - Improve code formatting and indentation
   - Remove obvious code duplication by extracting small helper functions
   - Keep overall structure unchanged
3. **DO NOT**:
   - Apply design patterns
   - Restructure algorithm logic
   - Change control flow
   - Add new abstractions or classes
4. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
5. **Length Constraint**: Keep code length similar to original (±20% lines of code)

Target: Cyclomatic complexity should remain similar (±10%)


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
