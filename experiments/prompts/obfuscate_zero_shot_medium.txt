Obfuscate the following {language} code with MEDIUM intensity to make it moderately harder to understand while preserving its exact functionality.

Original code:
```{language}
{code}
```

MEDIUM Obfuscation Requirements:
1. **Preserve Semantics**: The obfuscated code MUST produce identical outputs for all inputs
2. **Moderate Changes**: Apply these techniques:
   - Rename ALL variables to meaningless names (x1, x2, tmp, arr, val, etc.)
   - Remove ALL comments and docstrings
   - Restructure logic using equivalent but less clear patterns:
     * Replace clear if-else with ternary operators where possible
     * Combine or split statements to obscure intent
     * Add intermediate variables for simple operations
   - Reorder independent statements to break logical grouping
   - Change loop styles (for ↔ while) where semantically equivalent
3. **Maintain Validity**: Code must compile and run without errors
4. **Keep recognizable**: Overall function structure should still be visible
5. **Length Constraint**: Code may be up to 50% longer than original, but avoid bloat

Target: Cyclomatic complexity may increase by 20-50%


CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY executable code
- NO explanations, reasoning, or commentary
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```)
- NO <think> tags or thinking process
- NO preamble like "Here is..." or "The code is..."
- Start directly with the first line of code
- End with the last line of code
- The output must be directly executable in a {language} interpreter
